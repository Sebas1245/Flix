## Notes

Some of the challenges that this assignment had was building the table views, then adding the tab bar controller, and the collection grid view. Both types of views were something new that I had to learn to implement and working with the tab bar controller gave me some unexpected issues when trying to run the project.

Another big challenge was testing the loading indicator, since installation of an additional Xcode tool was required (Network Link Conditioner). I had a tough time installing this tool, but it was worth it when I finally got it working.
